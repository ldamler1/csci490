File orginazation for these projects is a mess and I don't have the time or motivation to fix it. The important bits are in the src folder if you feel so inclined to run it yourself. The rest of the folders are for other purposes and created by the eclipse c++ compiler. Reports and report folders are also included displaying results and interpretation of the program that was run.

Assignment 1 lacks data files and I no longer have access to them. Output is included but the report was lost and I don't have    time to find it.

Assignment 2 should include a report folder as well as numerous graphs displaying standard deviations for each experiment.
  - the data folder holds all 10 datasets for each species that the experiments were run on
  - std_files hold the standard deviation output used to create the graphs
  - files is a folder that simply holds the path to the proper dataset to be run. It is specifically used by the program and       shouldn't be modified
  
Assignment 3 includes the important src files, data similar to assignment 2, a report and graphs on the experiments
  -output is kind of a mess and can be found in the StandardDeviation folder. The files used to create the graphs can be found    in the C0_T1T2, C0_W12W20, C5_T1T2, and C5_W12W20 text files. that data was used to make the graphs in the excel                spreadsheets found in the report folder.
